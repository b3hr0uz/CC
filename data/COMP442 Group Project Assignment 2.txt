Data exploration using statistical descriptions 
For data preprocessing to be successful, it is essential to have an overall picture of your data. Basic statistical descriptions can be used to identify properties of the data and highlight which data values should be treated as noise or outliers.

While structured datasets can be directly analyzed using statistical measures, many real-world applications involve unstructured data such as images, videos, or text. In this assignment, the dataset consists of images with corresponding label data. To analyze such data, you must first apply feature extraction techniques to convert image content into structured numerical features that can be explored statistically. For example, using tools such as OpenCV, you may extract attributes such as color histograms, edge counts, textures, key points, or other image descriptors. These extracted features, combined with the provided labels, create a structured dataset suitable for statistical analysis and machine learning.

Central tendency measures the location of the middle or center of data distribution.  Intuitively speaking, given an attribute, where do most of its values fall? In particular, we discuss the mean, median, mode, and midrange. In addition to assessing the central tendency of our data set, we also would like to have an idea of the dispersion of the data. That is, how are the data spread out? The most common data dispersion measures are the range, quartiles, and interquartile range; the five-number summary and boxplots; and the variance and standard deviation of the data. These measures are useful for identifying outliers. 

Skewness is a measure of asymmetry or distortion of symmetric distribution. It measures the deviation of the given distribution of a random variable from a symmetric distribution, such as normal distribution. A normal distribution is without any skewness, as it is symmetrical on both sides. Hence, a curve is regarded as skewed if it is shifted towards the right or the left.

Class imbalanced: A classification data set with skewed class proportions is called imbalanced. Classes that make up a large proportion of the data set are called majority classes. Those that make up a smaller proportion are minority classes. Most learning algorithms assume data is equally distributed. So when we have a class imbalance, the machine learning classifier tends to be more biased towards the majority class, causing bad classification of the minority class.

Correlation explains how one or more attributes are related to each other. These attributes can be input data attributes which have been used to forecast our target attribute. Correlation is a statistical technique which determines how one attributes moves/changes in relation to the other variable. It gives us an idea about the degree of the relationship between the two attributes. Pearson correlation coefficients and chi-square test are widely used for numeric and categorical attributes, respectively. 

These analyses may directly address the project goals; they may also contribute to or refine the data description and quality reports, and feed into the transformation and other data preparation steps needed for further analysis.
