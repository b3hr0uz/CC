## Assignment 2: Statistical Analysis Implementation

### 1. Data Exploration Using Statistical Descriptions

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive statistical analysis for the Spambase dataset to understand data characteristics and support effective machine learning model selection.

### 2. Central Tendency Analysis

**Implementation**: 
- **Mean**: Calculated for all 57 numerical features
- **Median**: Robust measure less affected by outliers
- **Mode**: Most frequent values in discrete features
- **Midrange**: Average of minimum and maximum values

**Code Location**: `backend/app/main.py` - `/statistics` endpoint

**Results**:
- Spam percentage: ~39.4% (class imbalance identified)
- Feature distributions show significant variance across attributes
- Word frequency features show right-skewed distributions

### 3. Dispersion Measures

**Implemented Measures**:
- **Range**: Maximum - Minimum for each feature
- **Quartiles**: Q1, Q2 (median), Q3 calculations
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Q3 - Q1 
- **Variance**: Measure of spread around the mean
- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance
- **Five-number Summary**: Min, Q1, Median, Q3, Max

**Outlier Detection**: Used IQR method (values beyond Q1-1.5*IQR or Q3+1.5*IQR)

### 4. Skewness Analysis

**Implementation**: 
- Calculated skewness for all numerical features using scipy.stats
- **Results**:
  - Most word frequency features show **positive skewness** (right-skewed)
  - Capital letter features show extreme positive skewness
  - Character frequency features vary in skewness direction

**Interpretation**:
- **Positive Skew**: Most emails have low frequencies of spam-related words
- **High Skewness**: Indicates potential outliers and need for data transformation
- **Distribution Shape**: Guides preprocessing and model selection decisions

### 5. Class Imbalance Analysis

**Findings**:
- **Spam Class**: ~39.4% of dataset (1813 samples)
- **Ham Class**: ~60.6% of dataset (2788 samples)
- **Imbalance Ratio**: Approximately 1.54:1

**Implications**:
- Standard ML algorithms may be biased toward majority class (ham)
- Implemented cross-validation to ensure robust model evaluation
- Considered class weights and balanced sampling techniques

### 6. Correlation Analysis

**Implementation**:
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficients** for all feature pairs
- **Top Correlated Features with Target** (spam/ham classification)
- **Feature-Feature Correlations** to identify redundancy

**Key Findings**:
- Strong positive correlations between certain word frequencies and spam classification
- Capital letter run length shows high correlation with spam
- Some features show multicollinearity requiring feature selection

**Code Implementation**:
```python
# Correlation matrix calculation
correlation_matrix = df.corr()
spam_correlations = correlation_matrix['is_spam'].abs().sort_values(ascending=False)
```

- Interactive model comparison charts
- Feature correlation heatmaps
- Performance metrics visualization

**User Interface**:
- Model selection dropdown
- K-fold configuration options
- Real-time prediction testing

### 9. Performance Results

**Cross-Validation Results** (5-fold average):
- **Gradient Boosting**: F1-Score ~0.94, Accuracy ~95%
- **Logistic Regression**: F1-Score ~0.92, Accuracy ~93%
- **Neural Network**: F1-Score ~0.93, Accuracy ~94%
- **Naive Bayes**: F1-Score ~0.89, Accuracy ~91%

## Data Quality Assessment

### 10. Missing Values Analysis
- **Result**: No missing values detected in Spambase dataset
- **Verification**: Implemented automated missing value detection

### 11. Outlier Detection Results
- **Method**: IQR-based outlier detection
- **Findings**: Significant outliers in capital letter and character frequency features
- **Treatment**: Retained outliers as they may represent genuine spam characteristics

### 12. Feature Distribution Analysis
- **Normal Distribution**: Few features follow normal distribution
- **Log-Normal**: Many word frequency features after log transformation
- **Skewed Distributions**: Majority of features require transformation for certain algorithms
