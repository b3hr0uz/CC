3. Objective

Our goal for this project was to develop a comprehensive spam email detection system that combines traditional machine learning with advanced reinforcement learning techniques. The project addresses both technical and business requirements in the domain of email security and user experience enhancement.

Technical Objectives:
- Develop a robust email classification system with >90% accuracy
- Implement reinforcement learning to enable continuous improvement from user feedback
- Create a context-aware AI assistant using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline
- Build a production-ready system with microservices architecture
- Achieve response times <300ms for real-time email classification

Business Objectives:
- Create a self-contained desktop application that preserves user privacy
- Integrate with Gmail to process real user emails through OAuth2 authentication
- Provide an intelligent assistant that can query and analyze email content
- Enable personalized spam detection that adapts to individual user patterns
- Deliver a modern, user-friendly web interface for interaction

The project successfully achieved all primary objectives, delivering a system with 95.0% F1-score using our XGBoost + Reinforcement Learning model, response times averaging 150ms, and a fully functional assistant with real-time streaming responses and semantic search capabilities. Our business success criteria have been met through the creation of a privacy-preserving, containerized Single Page Application (SPA) that processes real Gmail data while continuously learning from user feedback through 11 real-world user interactions.

==============================================================================

4. Background Information

Spam email detection represents one of the most practical applications of machine learning in cybersecurity. With over 14.5 billion spam emails sent daily worldwide, effective classification systems are critical for maintaining productivity and security.

Key Terminology:
- Spam: Unsolicited commercial emails, phishing attempts, or malicious content
- Ham: Legitimate emails that users want to receive
- False Positives: Ham emails incorrectly classified as spam (high business cost)
- False Negatives: Spam emails incorrectly classified as ham (security risk)

Traditional Approach Limitations:
Conventional spam filters rely on static rule-based systems or basic machine learning models that cannot adapt to evolving spam techniques. These systems suffer from:
- High false positive rates affecting legitimate business communications
- Inability to learn from user preferences and behaviors
- Limited context understanding for personalized classification
- Lack of semantic understanding of email content

Our Innovation:
ContextCleanse addresses these limitations through three key innovations:

1. Reinforcement Learning Enhancement: Our XGBoost + RL model continuously learns from user feedback, implementing Deep Q-Learning and Policy Gradient algorithms to adapt to individual user preferences and emerging spam patterns.

2. Context-Aware Assistant: Integration of LLaMA 3:8B model through Ollama with a RAG pipeline enables semantic understanding of email content, allowing users to query their email data in natural language.

3. Multi-Model Architecture: Seven different machine learning models are trained and compared, ensuring optimal performance through ensemble methods and model selection.

Dataset Evolution:
Initially, we considered the Enron email dataset (500,000+ emails) but found it too large and unstructured for our academic timeline. We selected the UCI Spambase dataset (4,601 pre-processed emails) which provided:
- Structured feature vectors (57 attributes)
- Balanced representation of spam/ham classes
- Established benchmark for performance comparison
- Manageable size for iterative development and testing

The dataset's features include word frequency percentages, character frequency percentages, and capital letter statistics, providing rich signals for classification algorithms.
